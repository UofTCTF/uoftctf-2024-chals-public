# Baby Shellcode

For the uninitiated, shellcode is a piece of code that spawns a shell. This is usually used in exploits to spawn a shell on a remote machine.

A shellcode is usually written in assembly and is usually very small in size. Then it is converted to machine code and is injected into the program.

So there's nothing too interesting here, just write a simple shellcode that spawns a shell.

Or you can find a shellcode online and use that.

Once you have the shellcode, pass it as input to the program,
and it will spawn a shell for you.
