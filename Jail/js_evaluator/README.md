# JS Evaluator

Last year, I found a [critical security vulnerability in Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92). I heard `path.evaluate()` is secure now, but it still wasn't useful enough for me. I added some code to enhance the functionality, without impacting the security!
