From the company "Novespace" we can easily determine it is French and based in the Bordeaux region. [The following link](https://www.airzerog.com/novespace-and-avico/) states "Based in the Bordeaux-Mérignac airport area" so the airport is Bordeaux-Mérignac and 3-letter IATA code is BOD.

Taking a look at the plane, we can check the tail logo via [the following tool](https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails/). We see that the airline is Air Nostrum from [this](https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails/i-tbxJNgq/A). However, Air Nostrum is now in a merger and the logo was held by Iberia ([based on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia_(airline)#/media/File:Iberia_logo.svg)) in 2012.

Additionally, this is confirmed by the fact that Air Nostrum doesn't own any long-haul aircraft with 4 engines ([see here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120720152644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Nostrum)). We can thus conclude the aircraft is owned by Iberia.

We can now narrow down a list of aircraft using [this tool](https://www.aircraftrecognitionguide.com/identify-aircraft/identify-by-airplane-characteristics). The characteristics are:
* 4 jets
* Engines under wings
* Swept wings
* Nose wheel landing gear

We see a collection of aircraft including the A340.

From [Iberia's wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia_(airline)), we can see the only 4-engine aircraft owned by Iberia in 2012 is the Airbus A340-600 or A340-300. So the flag is:

**UofTCTF{BOD_Iberia_A340-600}** or **UofTCTF{BOD_Iberia_A340-300}** (both were accepted)
