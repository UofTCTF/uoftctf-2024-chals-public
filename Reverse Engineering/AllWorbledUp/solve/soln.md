# Solution

This challenge is simply disassembled Python bytecode. The objective is to reconstruct the source script (`worbler.py`) and find the flag based on the given output. The regex gives a hint as to what characters and how many of them the flag has.

The solve script is in the solve directory as `soln.py`. Running it should produce the flag.
