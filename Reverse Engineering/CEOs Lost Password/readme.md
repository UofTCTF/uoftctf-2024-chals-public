Challenge: CEO's lost password

Description: Hello there brave programmer!

I am the CEO of TotallySecureBankâ„¢, I have a lot of money in my bank account but I forgot my password! My username is `admin` and I have $100000 in my account.

If you could recover my account you can use my password as a flag (flag would be `uoftctf{MyPasswordHere}`)

You can try the bank software by running `java -jar BankChallenge.jar` and use the example user `user` with the password being `example`.
