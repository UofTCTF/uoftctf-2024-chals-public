Challenge: CSS Password

Description: My web developer friend said JavaScript is insecure so he made a password vault with CSS. Can you find the password to open the vault? 

Wrap the flag in `uoftctf{}`

Make sure to use a browser that supports the CSS `:has` selector, such as Firefox 121+ or Chrome 105+. The challenge is verified to work for Firefox 121.0.
