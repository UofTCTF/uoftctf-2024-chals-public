# Love Debug - Source

All of the bf code here was originally written in a C-like language
compiled to Brainf**k using [this compiler](https://github.com/arthaud/c2bf).

The Brainf**k code was then compiled to native x86-64
using [a compiler made by yours truly](https://github.com/kako57/bf-compiler)

`love-letter-for-you.bf` is the code for the challenge.
Depending on the terminal, it might print a squished heart
or a squished heart.

If you want the code for the "fixed" heart, in here
are three sources for the three different terminals
I use the most. These don't include the challenge,
so feel free to send hearts to people ~~while f**king
their brains out~~.

```
alacritty.bf         # for alacritty
vscode.bf            # for vscode terminal
windows-terminal.bf  # for windows terminal
```
