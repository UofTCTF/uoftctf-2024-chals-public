To solve this puzzle you first need to notice that the guestbook HTML code references a google sheet with id `1PGFh37vMWFrdOnIoItnxiGAkIqSxlJDiDyklp9OVtoQ`

Opening https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PGFh37vMWFrdOnIoItnxiGAkIqSxlJDiDyklp9OVtoQ we find all the guestbook entery

Doing a quick search for "uofctf" shows that we are on the right track because it finds a partial flag in a hidden sheet

To access the hidden sheet we can download the sheet as a .xlsx file (or make a copy) which would include the hidden sheets.
